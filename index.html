            <p style="margin-left: 20%; margin-right: 20%; text-align: justify;">As a first-year student at RoseBank
                College, I am currently
                pursuing a Diploma in Information Technology, specializing in Software Development. Coding for me is
                akin to building a Lego set—each line of code is a brick, and the final program or website is a
                completed masterpiece. I pride myself on exceptional time management, consistently going to bed by 9:30
                PM and completing all my tasks well ahead of schedule. Being extroverted, I thrive in team environments
                with good chemistry, but I am equally adept at working independently. My problem-solving starts as soon
                as a challenge is presented, often going the extra mile to enhance functionality or aesthetics. My
                dedication and diligence are evident in my near-perfect attendance, even when I'm the sole student
                present in class.
                <br><br>
                Outside of coding, I thrive in the great outdoors. I love visiting national parks and animal
                sanctuaries, and I take immense pride in my gardening skills. I’ve successfully nurtured various plants
                and even rescued succulents from near death, sometimes growing new ones from dropped leaves. My deep
                compassion for all creatures means I can hardly swat a fly without an apology. For years, I’ve been
                feeding wild birds in my garden, and now a loyal flock of pigeons walks up to me, food or no food in
                hand. I also care for two happy budgies named Blue and Chirp. As a registered Emergency First Aid
                Responder (EFAR), I am always ready to jump to someones aid.
